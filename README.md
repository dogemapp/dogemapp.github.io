This repo will support the website for the DogEm app. 

Our site's URL will be sent to the CS faculty. 
The website will have:
- Links to all the different things we hand in: project selection, project plan, status reports, final reports, etc. All documentation must be present on the github pages via a linking system. 
- MUST be pleasant to view, easy to navigate, and have some form of cohesive style. 
- If you apply for C-Day this can possibly be a contributing factor for selection.
